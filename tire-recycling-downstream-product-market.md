<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Recycling Downstream Product Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrolysis Recycling Technique</li><li>Shredding Recycling Technique</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tire recycling downstream product markets primarily involve two techniques: pyrolysis and shredding. Pyrolysis utilizes high heat to break down tires into oil, carbon black, and gas, creating valuable products for energy and manufacturing. Shredding, on the other hand, mechanically reduces tires into small pieces for use in applications like asphalt, rubber mats, and mulch. Both methods contribute to sustainable waste management, converting waste tires into usable materials while reducing environmental impact.</p></p>
